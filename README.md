* CIMI RM 1.0.10.xml -- CIMI 1 series reference model -- EA Export
* CIMI RM 2.0.0.xml -- CIMI 2 series reference model
* examples.xml -- Instance examples of AMLObjectModel.xml.  Still needs new diagram and fixup.
* fix -- Shell script to change from absolute to relative file paths.  Always run this before doing a commit/push. (Only works on a Mac...)
* mdr.xml -- ISO 11179 Profile.  To be integrated
* README.md -- this file
* report -- Directory for reporting specifications
* specification.xml -- Specification outline and model diagrams. **Open this file in MagicDraw**
